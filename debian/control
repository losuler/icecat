Description: IceCat is the GNU version of the Firefox
 browser. Its main advantage is an ethical one: it is
 entirely free software. While the Firefox source code from
 the Mozilla project is free software, they distribute and
 recommend nonfree software as plug-ins and addons. Also
 their trademark license imposes requirements for the
 distribution of modified versions that make it
 inconvenient to exercise freedom 3.
